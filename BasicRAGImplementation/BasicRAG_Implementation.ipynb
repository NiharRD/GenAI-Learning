This standard provides a revised earthquake \\nzone map considering the known faults, the maximum size of events likely on these faults, the attenuation of the \\nground shaking with distance, tectonics and lithology ( see Annex C ) across the country.  The earthquake zone \\nmap provided in this standard reflects the relative peak ground accelerations likely across the landmass of India. \\nThese peak ground accelerations can be statistically correlated to the i ntensity of earthquake ground shaking \\nmeasured on the 1964 MSK scale. \\n \\nSafety of people in a structure during earthquakes depends on two factors, namely:  \\na) Structural Elements  — How the structural elements ( SEs) of a building or structure individually and  \\ntogether resist the design earthquake shaking, without local or global collapse of the building or structure; \\nand \\n \\nb) Architectural Elements and Utilities — How the  non-structural elements , hereinafter called as the \\narchitectural elements and utilities (AEUs), namely contents, appendages, and services and utilities,  of a \\nbuilding or structure, are held by or rested on SEs, such that they do not jeopardize the safety of persons \\nin the building and/or structure.  \\n \\nSo far, significant attention was given to t he former. Safety of the people can be jeopardized, even if the SEs \\nperform as expected, but AEU s fail to withstand earthquake shaking.  In countries that managed to reduce loss of \\nlife by preventing collapse of buildings and structures, losses in recent e arthquakes indicate that losses of life and \\ndamage to property are not eliminated yet owing to poor performance of AEU s.  These losses of life and damage \\nto property have major social or economic implications, particularly in critical buildings and structu res (for \\nexample, governance buildings, hospitals, and schools) and commercial buildings and structures (for example, \\nmalls, convention cent res, and milk and food supply stores).  \\n \\nThis standard provides the requirements for the:  \\na)  Design of SE s — The min imum design earthquake lateral forces to be considered in the design of SEs.  \\nThe structures designed by these provisions are expected to sustain damage when subjected to design \\nground shaking specified in t his standard, but not collapse ; and  \\n \\nb)  Protecti on of AEU s — The minimum design earthquake lateral forces and design earthquake lateral \\ndisplacements to be considered in the design of the connection of the AEU s with the SEs.  The \\nconnection s of AEUs  designed by these provisions are expected to perform b etter than those merely \\nprovided without following these provisions, when the structure is subjected to design ground shaking \\nspecified in this standard.  \\n \\nThese are minimum provisions that should be complied with to ensur e the safety of the SEs and AEU s.  The owner \\nof the structure may choose to reduce the damage in the SEs and AEU s under design earthquake ground shaking \\neffects, by prescribing design lateral forces and displacements that are higher than those specified in this standard.  \\n \\nThis standard was  first published in 1962 with the title ‘Recommendations for earthquake -resistant  design of \\nstructures’, and revised in 1966, 1970, 1975 and 1984.
